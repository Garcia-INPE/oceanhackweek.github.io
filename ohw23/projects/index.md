# Hacking at OHW23

## How will the projects be conducted?

We encourage project ideas from participants! Feel free to discuss existing or new project ideas **#ohw23_project** Slack channel prior to the event. Once ideas begin to gel and collaborative groups begin to form, the group can start getting into the weeds using a [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1lOgVwnqQLvNRPAOEVEGnWXm8FSTuPYQWbteptKrslTM/viewer?f=0). Later the group needs to create and present a visual [elevator speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) using one [Google Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eQKSdFHNGMDqGJMY4d-yGnNm4UrUj5kIS2mLQGPMZC8/edit#slide=id.p), create a project Slack channel that starts with `ohw23_proj_` (say, `ohw23_proj_upwelling`), and create a Github repository (follow [these instructions](https://oceanhackweek.org/resources/prep/git.html#create-a-project-repository)). 

We've scheduled part of Day 1 and the early part of Day 2 for project ideation. After that, time not allocated to shared tutorials and discussions may be devoted to working on the projects - hacking!

Please look over the information below for guidance about projects, how to get started and the motivations for working on projects.


<!--We have put together a [few questions](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/discussions/discussions/categories/ohw22-project-planning) that can help you propose a project in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/discussions/discussions/categories/ohw22-project-planning).

On Monday August 15th we will have a brief “project setup” session for an overview of all projects already proposed up to that point, and give another opportunity to pitch new ideas that may be formed throughout the day. Project proposals must be submitted by the end of this day (Day 1). Each satellite may have its own, specific deadline time, so please connect with your satellite or the global event for details.-->
