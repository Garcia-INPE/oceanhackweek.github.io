# Logistics Overview

Some of you will participate in person in Seattle or Perth and others will participate virtually from time zones all over the world. Each of these gathering styles has strengths and weaknesses. We are committed to providing an engaging and full experience for everyone and will strive to facilitate cross communication and collaboration across all participants.

## Time

OceanHackWeek 2023 will take place:\
August 7-11 for the virtual event and the in-person event in Seattle, US\
August 8-12 for the in-person event in Western Australia

**Details coming soon regarding specific times of participation throughout the day for in-person and virtual contingents.**
<!--**In-person participants** will gather for times as directed by the relevant in-person organizers. While **virtual participants** may choose to engage primarily with this group and schedule via Zoom and Slack, we strongly encourage you to join the program designed specifically as a virtual event. The virtual event will be split into two schedules and groups based on the distribution of participant time zones, in a 3-hour daily block of formal, live activities. The **larger virtual event** will take place 11:00am - 2:00pm PDT / 18:00 - 21:00 UTC.-->

Detailed schedules are available [Schedule page](../../ohw23/schedule.md).

## Channel of communication: Slack

We will use the [OceanHackWeek Slack workspace](http://oceanhackweek.slack.com/) as the main channel of communication before, during, and after the hackweek. You should have received an invitation to join this workspace. If you haven't seen it in your inbox, check your spam folder, or email us at *oceanhkw@uw.edu*.

[Go directly from a channel or direct message chat into a voice or video chat](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack), with screen-sharing capability. This will be particularly useful during hack project time.
