# Schedule

**OceanHackWeek 2022 will take place August 15-19.**

With a global virtual event and many satellites, this schedule is still very much under development. The global virtual event will be meeting from 11-2 Pacific, and most satellites are planning at least part of their day around that time block to encourage cross-satellite interaction.
