# OceanHackWeek 2023 (OHW23)

OceanHackWeek 2023 (OHW23) is a hands-on, interactive workshop focused on data science in oceanography and fisheries. It will take place on **August 7-11, 2023** as a hybrid in-person and virtual, online event. The in-person event will take place at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu), in Seattle, Washington (US PDT, UTC-7), as an all-day workshop (approximately 9am - 5pm). For the virtual event, formal daily activities will take place over a period of up to 3 hours per day. We expect to hold these sessions in at least two time zones, USA EDT (UTC-4) and probably Australian EST (UTC+10).

The [**Global Virtual Event**](global/index) will take place through synchronous 3-hour periods per day and asynchronous collaboration. It will include all interactive OHW22 tutorials delivered in real time, project brainstorming, and other OHW-wide community building activities. The tutorials will be recorded and posted after the presentation. The exact hours of this global event are still being finalized, but we anticipate the activity time to be structured around the US Pacific Time (UTC-7) this year.
