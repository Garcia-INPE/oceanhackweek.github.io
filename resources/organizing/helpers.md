# Tutorial Helpers

### Tutorial moderators
- Make sure to follow Code of Conduct in interacting on Slack
- Ask tutorial presenter ahead of time if:
   - they would like to answer questions throughout the tutorial, or hold questions until the end
   - they would like the moderator to ask the questions from Slack, or read the questions on Slack themselves
- Remind participants to add questions to the tutorials Slack channel and to upvote questions they want answered
- Introduce the tutorial and tutorial presenter
- Ask questions (if requested by the presenter) that have the most `+1` reactions
- Add a âœ… to Q&A questions answered on Slack
- Add a ðŸ”¥ to burning Q&A questions that should be answered by presenter (not needed if moderator reads out questions for the presenter)
- Keep track of time and end session on time

### Tutorial helpers (i.e. other organizers/mentors on the Zoom call available to help)
- Make sure to follow Code of Conduct when interacting on Slack
- Help answer questions if you can
- Upvote (add `+1` emoji) questions you think are important
- If questions pop up in other channels unrelated to the tutorials, please answer if you can or ping [the appropriate team](../logistics/getting_help.md#slack-help-groups)
- If there are answers at the end of the tutorial that did not get answered, please ping [the appropriate team](../logistics/getting_help.md#slack-help-groups)
