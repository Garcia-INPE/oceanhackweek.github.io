# Tutorial Helpers

- Make sure to follow Code of Conduct in interacting on slack
- A question is asked:
  - If you know the answer, please answer it 
  - If you know partially the answer, please also answer, and ping [a team](../logistics/getting_help.md#slack-help-groups) who may know the answer
  - If no answers show up after some time, ping [a team](../logistics/getting_help.md#slack-help-groups) who may know the answer
- We will keep a few breakout rooms open on Zoom, feel free to move there to answer questions in detail/resolve problems
- Vote up the questions they want the moderator to push to instructor (also make sure to let participants know that)
