# Project Overview

Collaborative projects are a key component of OceanHackWeek, in which you get to interact with others closely and apply new skills to make something exciting happen: it can be creating tools to streamline access of a particular data source, visualizing some high density data interactively, testing existing models with new data sources, or anything else you may want to do at the intersection of oceanography and data science.

## Tips for getting started

* Potentially choose something that you've been interested but haven't had the time or skills to do before, or something you can continue to work on post OceanHackWeek!
* Hacking is a community activity! It's okay to choose projects that you can't accomplish alone as other people will be there to help you, both at OceanHackWeek and outside of it!
* Help your group member: you might be the person they need to solve their problem, and vice versa.
* When discussing, pitch your explanation to the least experienced hacker in the group, and you'll end up better understanding what you're trying to do, or need to revise your idea.
* You can mix programming languages as needed in order to get started, but do check in with your project mentors and group members to make sure your efforts are straightforward to be absorbed into the project.

## What is a Hack?

A "hack" is a small project that aims to solve a specific problem using computational tools.

Examples of hacks include:

* Build a working demo of a new or modified algorithm
* Outline of a larger project, with some key features scoped
* Visualization of an old dataset in a new manner
* Modify an algorithm and apply it to a new dataset
* Combine two pre-existing pieces of code to perform some new function
* Create a tool to apply to work with existing code, datasets
* Transform code from one language to another to use with other tools
* Update old code to run faster, on new machines, and/or more efficiently
* Extend an existing project with an additional feature
* Simplify code to be more maintainable, aka "paying technical debt"

## Why hack at OceanHackWeek?

Increasingly, research and software development are conducted by groups of people with diverse skills and backgrounds. We believe this collaborative work leads to more innovative solutions to complex problems. At OceanHackWeek, our goal is to explore with you some of the skills needed to navigate technical and social challenges of working in these kinds of collaborative settings. We believe the best way to do so is to provide opportunities for you to gain hands-on experience in working together with others on a well-defined problem related to ocean sciences.


<!-- * Start with ideas that are close to home: your research, a project for your company, something you have always been interested in. -->
<!-- * Start with one simple idea first, and when it is built add complexity afterwards. -->
<!-- * Help your neighbor: you might be the person they need to solve their problem, and vice versa. -->

<!-- ## How will the projects be conducted?

* On day 1 we will facilitate the sharing of ideas and formation of people into small teams (2-5 people)
* Once formed, each team will be guided through exercises to help narrow in on a set of tasks that are doable within the 5 days. A brief project outline will be posted to GitHub, following the "Project Guidelines" below.


## What can I do to prepare in advance?

* If you have a project idea already brewing, we encourage you to share that with the team on the #project channel on Slack. We can add additional channels as the project ideas develop.
* Feel free to explore various projects and initiate conversations. The goal is to gather as much information as you can to inform your decision about which team to join when we meet in person.
* Contact an Oceanhackweek organizer if you would like assistance in assessing whether a project is well-scoped, or if you need help with a particular dataset. 


## OceanHackWeek specifics

* Who are you going to hack with? Here's [a list of your fellow hackers](participants_2019)
* What are you going to work on? [Project guidelines and ideas](project_guidelines)
* Start pitching ideas on our [#projects slack](https://oceanhackweek2019.slack.com) channel, and then once projects materialize, we can migrate to a separate project channel
* Begin populating an Oceanhackweek GitHub project page - instructions coming soon
