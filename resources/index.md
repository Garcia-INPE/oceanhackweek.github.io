To make sure that OHW22 will be a welcoming environment for everyone, please read our [Code of Conduct](/about/code-of-conduct.md) carefully as part of your preparation. We expect all participants to adhere to the Code of Conduct in all interactions throughout the hackweek.

## Preparation

We will use a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub)-based online environment for all OceanHackWeek computational activities, including tutorials; this environment supports both Python and R. You will need a robust internet connection and a capable laptop or desktop computer. 

We will use Slack, Zoom and GitHub as our primary communication and content delivery platforms. The week before OceanHackWeek you will receive via email an invitation to join the OceanHackWeek GitHub organization, [https://github.com/oceanhackweek/](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/) if you have not received it already, along with Slack invites and Zoom connection info.
