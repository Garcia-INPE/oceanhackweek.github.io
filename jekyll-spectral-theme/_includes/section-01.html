			<h2>About OceanHackWeek</h2>
			<p>
				OceanHackWeek (OHW) is a 4-day collaborative learning experience aimed at exploring,
				creating and promoting effective computation and analysis workflows for
				large and complex oceanographic data. It includes tutorials, data exploration, software development, collaborative projects and community networking.
				Its objectives are to:
				<ul style="text-align: left">
					<li>Promote data and software proficiency in ocean scientists: 
						Provide participants with computational and data science skills that can 
						advance oceanography research, which often requires the integration and 
						manipulation of diverse sources of data and models.
					</li>
					<li>Facilitate inclusive community building: 
						Connect oceanographers across disciplines and career stages and cultivate 
						an open science and a sharing culture.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				OceanHackWeek 2021 will take place as a hybrid in-person and virtual, online event. 
				The in-person event will take place at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, in East Boothbay, Maine (US EDT, UTC-4), as an all-day workshop (approximately 9am - 5pm). For the virtual event, formal daily activities will take place over a period of up to 3 hours per day. We expect to hold these sessions in at least two time zones, USA PDT (UTC-7) and Australian EST (UTC+10).
