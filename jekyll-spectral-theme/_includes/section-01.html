			<h2>ABOUT OCEANHACKWEEK</h2>
			<p>
				OceanHackweek is a 5-day collaborative learning experience aimed at exploring,
				creating and promoting effective computation and analysis workflows for
				large and complex oceanographic data. Its objectives are to:
				<ul>
					<li>Promote data and software proficiency in ocean scientists: 
						Provide participants with computational and data science skills that can 
						advance oceanography research, which often requires the integration and 
						manipulation of diverse sources of data and models.
					</li>
					<li>Facilitate inclusive community building: 
						Connect oceanographers across disciplines and career stages and cultivate 
						an open science and a sharing culture.
					</li>
				</ul>

				(ADD DESCRIPTION OF THE GOALS FOR EAST VS WEST, AND HOW THIS DIFFERS
				FROM PREVIOUS YEARS)
