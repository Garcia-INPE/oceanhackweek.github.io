# Hacking at OHW22

## How will the projects be conducted?

We have put together a [few questions](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/discussions/discussions/categories/ohw22-project-planning) that can help you propose a project in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/discussions/discussions/categories/ohw22-project-planning).

On Monday August 15th we will have a brief “project setup” session for an overview of all projects already proposed up to that point, and give another opportunity to pitch new ideas that may be formed throughout the day. Project proposals must be submitted by the end of this day (Day 1). Each satellite may have its own, specific deadline time, so please connect with your satellite or the global event for details.
