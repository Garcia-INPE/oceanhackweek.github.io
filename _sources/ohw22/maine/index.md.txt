# US Northeast

This year we are having two parallel East Coast events in Maine.
One event will be held at Bigelow Labs in Boothbay, and the other at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland
​
## Schedule

For most days, plan that we will be meeting from 10 - 5.

On Wednesday, the GMRI folks will make their way up to Bigelow, so that we can hack as a full group together, explore another lab, have a cookout, and maybe go for a hike.
