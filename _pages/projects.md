Small group projects is an essential part of the HackWeek experience. The project teams are self-selected and the project topics are chosen by team participants based on their shared interests and inspired by Hackweek tutorials and demos. The Oceanhackweek organizing committee facilitated team formation, including brainstorming sessions and opportunities for participants to advertise their project ideas to the group. In total, Oceanhackweek 2018 participants worked on eleven projects. Each group gave a short presentation on their progress in the afternoon of the final day of the hackweek.

### Project: Echopype

An OpenSource tool for reading proprietary echosounder data formats into open source data analysis tools. This team demonstrated reading two common echosounder data formats into a Jupyter notebook. The team has form an independent Github organization ([OSOceanAcoustics](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics)) to continue work on this project beyond the hack week.

**Github Page**: [https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw18_echopype](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw18_echopype). The project continues to be developed at [https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype)


### Project: YodaIM

Building on the existing Yodapy -- “Your Ocean Data Access in Python” project (https://github.com/cormorack/yodapy), this team built a web API micro-service which gives a simple machine-readable interface to multiple Ocean data sources.

### Project: Ocean Machine LEarning Toolkit (OMLET)

This team used ocean properties data (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll) from multiple OOI sites (Station Papa, Coastal Pioneer and Endurance) to train machine learning algorithms to detect anomalous data patterns and predict parameters.

### Project:  Southern Ocean

This project integrated and visualized biogeochemical measurements from the OOI Southern Ocean sites with data from the SOCCOM Argo floats.

**Github Page**: [https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw18_southern-ocean](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw18_southern-ocean)


### Project:  Mussel Beach

The project combined two analyses:  First, it combined OOI cabled array passive acoustic data with public AIS records to look study the capacity of the cabled array to detect and track ships.   Second, multiple OOI and IOOS data sets were combined to assess and estimate mussel health.

### Project:  Sharknado

This team used information from a population of tagged sharks resident in Western Florida.   A Jupyter notebook was developed to visualize the track of individual sharks relative to Hurricane Irma in the fall of 2017.

### Project:  Profiles

Development of a Jupyter notebook which extracts and compares depth profile data from multiple sources in the OOI Endurance Array. Profilers, gliders, models. From OOI, IOOS/NANOOS, etc.

### Project:  LTER Visualization

Tools and tutorials for pulling together LTER and IOOS Datasets for encouraging cross-talk between ecology, oceanography, and physics communities.

**Github Page**: [https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw_lter_vis](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw_lter_vis)


### Project:  OOI Data Validation

Validating OOI data by cross plotting telemetered/recovered data, CTD cast data and water sampling data

**Github Page**: [https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw2018_Data_Validation](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw2018_Data_Validation)


### Project: Shallow Profiler Motion

Tools for reading and visualizing attitude data from the OOI Cabled Array shallow profiler platforms and science pods.

**Github page**: [https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw18_shallow_profiler_motion](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw18_shallow_profiler_motion)


### Project:  ERDDAP Explorer

An interactive Jupyter notebook for ERDAP exploration.
