OceanHackWeek is not just about learning, it is also about using what is learned to create exciting new tools in collaboration with others. The Oceanhackweek organizing committee worked hard to foster an inclusive and supportive learning environment based on the shared insterests of its members. They were awed by the creativity and dedication of the eleven groups that worked and presented a project during the conclusion of OceanHackWeek, and are proud to be able to share these projects here.

### Project: Template Matching to Identify Features in Vertical Profiles

Interested in finding a specific feature in your depth profiles? Want to know where those features are clustered? Then TMIVP, built upon the ideas of the visionary non-conformist demigod Procrustes, is for you. TMIVP aims to match and quantify the difference between a template profile and user-submitted data, clearly highlighting features for quality matching scores and location of problematic or interesting attributes. More broadly, this pipeline could be used to analyze and compare many types of graphs and profiles, including but not limited to:

- Michaelis-Menten population curves to characterize population growth
- Metabolomic and proteomic spectrographic peaks to understand analytical drift, matrix effects and other obscuring variations
- Environmental time series data to identify outliers
