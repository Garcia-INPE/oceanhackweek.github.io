OceanHackWeek (**OHW**) has taken place annually starting in 2018. Materials from past hackweeks are available, though they may be incomplete, particularly for older events. Links to past tutorials and projects are also provided in most cases.

OceanHackWeek was held as a virtual event for the first time in 2020; in 2019 and 2018 it was an in-person event with limited virtual access.
