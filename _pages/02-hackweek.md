[The hackweek model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00028) has emerged in the data
science community as a powerful tool for fostering exchange of ideas in research
and computation by providing training in modern data analysis workflows.
In contrast to conventional academic conferences or workshops, hackweeks are intensive
and interactive, facilitated by three core components: tutorials on state-of-the-art
methodologies, peer-learning, and on-site project work in a collaborative environment.
Compared to hackathons typically focused on software development, hackweeks have a greater 
focus on learning and open-ended projects as informal education and peer learning opportunities.
This setup is particularly powerful for sciences that require not only domain-specific
knowledge but also effective computational workflows to foster rapid exchange of ideas
and make discovery.

This is an excellent match with the nature of oceanographic research
where data are large and complex and the community is diverse and collaborative.
The hackweek model was spearheaded by the successful [*Astro-*](http://astrohackweek.org/2019/),
[*Neuro-*](https://neurohackweek.github.io/), and [*Geohackweek*](https://geohackweek.github.io/).
