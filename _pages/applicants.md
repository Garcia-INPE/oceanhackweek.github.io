In the Oceanhackweek we will explore the intersection of data science and oceanography through tutorials and hands-on
“hacking” projects. In tutorials, we will learn data science tools, cloud computing, visualization,
and a suite of software assets to interact with the continuous flow of data from the OOI.
In project sessions, we will immediately put these skills to use by implementing research,
computation, or visualization ideas in a group setting. Of particular interests are data sets of
complex temporal-spatial structures or high volume. To best benefit from the program, participants
are expected to have some experience with Python programming and data analysis.
