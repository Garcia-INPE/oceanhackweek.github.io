In the Oceanhackweek we will explore the intersection of data science and oceanography through tutorials and hands-on “hacking” projects. In tutorials, we will learn data science tools, cloud computing, visualization,
and a suite of software assets to interact with the continuous flow of data from the OOI.
In project sessions, we will immediately put these skills to use by implementing research,
computation, or visualization ideas in a group setting. Of particular interests are data sets of
complex temporal-spatial structures or high volume. To best benefit from the program, participants
are expected to have some experience with Python programming and data analysis.

Come back soon for application info for Oceanhackweek 2019! In the meantime, please read our FAQs to see how you can benefit from Oceanhackweek.

## FAQs

**I am proficient in Matlab/R/other language but I have not used Python. It has been on my list to learn. Can I still apply?**

We want to build an inclusive Oceanography community regardless of people’s language of choice and programming level. Since the event is only one week long, the tutorials will be presented in one language: (Python), and participants will benefit if they have a very basic familiarity with thise language. We will expect that you to have gone through the Software Carpentry Python Tutorial to get familiar with the syntax in advance of the program.



**I do not have any programming experience, what is the likely of my application being successful?**

If you do not have any programming experience we encourage you to start with some local or online training. Check if your institution runs a Software Carpentry workshop. Or try learning by some of these online resources:

We expect that you have gone through the [Software Carpentry Python Tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation) and have basic operational knowledge of Python in advance of the program. The more experience you can obtain before the beginning of the program, the easier it will be to follow the tutorials and contribute to the projects.


**I am an undergrad/first year grad/faculty/etc. Is this program right for me?**

We welcome participants from all career stages. We strongly encourage applications from graduate students, postdocs and early career researchers. There are different ways to contribute to the event: by pitching a project, by your knowledge of data sets, by your computational skills, by your project management skills. We want you to grow/learn during the event! We expect all participants to be engaged in the team projects and focus during the week. If in doubt, simply apply and explain your motivation for participation.

**I work in a ocean engineering/robotics/consulting company. Can I apply?**

Make sure to explain your motivation for participation in the application form!. We expect participants from the private sector to pay their own expenses. We will hold an industry panel, so please, mention if you will be interested in participating.


**I have strong computational skills but have not worked in oceanography?**

To ensure that participants will be interested in the oceanography problems they are solving and can give back to the field later on, we require that participants have had at least some familiarity or prior experience with oceanography data.
