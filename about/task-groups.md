# Task Groups

In order to make OceanHackWeek happen each year, we've found that we have a few core sets of tasks.

Accordingly we organize ourselves around those tasks, both so that we have a smaller number of folks to make decisions, but also to make it easier to know who to talk to about any issues.

Most of these groups have or will have Github teams & Slack user group or channel that you can use to communicate with them.
