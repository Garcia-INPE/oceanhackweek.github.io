# About

OceanHackWeek (OHW) is a 4-day collaborative learning experience aimed at exploring,
creating and promoting effective computation and analysis workflows for
large and complex oceanographic data. It includes tutorials, data exploration, software development, collaborative projects and community networking.

Its objectives are to:

- Promote data and software proficiency in ocean scientists: Provide participants with computational and data science skills that can advance oceanography research, which often requires the integration and manipulation of diverse sources of data and models.
- Facilitate inclusive community building: Connect oceanographers across disciplines and career stages and cultivate an open science and a sharing culture.
