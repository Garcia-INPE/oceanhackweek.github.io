<p>OceanHackWeek (OHW) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any OHW venues in either in-person or virtual form, including the Slack workspace. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from OHW at the discretion of the organizers.</p>

<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.</li>
  <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
  <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
  <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
  <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
  <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
  <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from OceanHackWeek with no refund.</p>

<p>OceanHackWeek organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all the event venues and event-related social activities.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-a-violation">Reporting a violation</h2>
<p>Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of OceanHackWeek for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to one of the instructors. You can make a report either personally or anonymously. <strong>Anonymous reports can be made <a href="https://oceanhackweek.wufoo.com/forms/zep2ybt1swlulc/">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.</p>

<h2 id="group-discussion">Group discussion</h2>
<p><strong>Q: What can each of us do to make OceanHackWeek an optimal learning environment that is inclusive and welcoming for everyone?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Give people room to express themselves, helping them achieve what they want to achieve this week</li>
  <li>Be helpful and spend some time jumping start someone with coding.</li>
  <li>Open to new ideas and ways of approaching a problem, being approachable</li>
  <li>Organizers are also here to learn from others and certainly don’t have all the answers!</li>
  <li>Be cognizant of different locations and time zones, engagement levels</li>
  <li>Allow and encourage different ways to engage, not just need to engage via video - like this google doc!</li>
  <li>Don’t use language like “obviously” or “clearly” (don’t assume something is easy for others)</li>
  <li>Ask questions, all the questions.</li>
  <li>Cameras on, so people can see that you’re engaged</li>
  <li>Build bridges between all three groups by reaching out to virtual/in-person participants</li>
  <li>Making sure everyone is working from a common knowledge baseline</li>
  <li>Listen actively and pay attention +1)</li>
  <li>Creating specific times/spaces for individuals to bring up questions/concerns - helps shy folks get a chance to communicate</li>
  <li>Specifically ask folks who are quieter if they would like to contribute (but don’t pressure them)</li>
  <li>Listening and adjusting behaviour if someone expresses discomfort about a behaviour</li>
  <li>Letting others know if you are uncomfortable– especially the person causing you the discomfort if it feels safe to do so</li>
  <li>Patient and understanding that everyone from different backgrounds and experiences</li>
  <li>Communicating in open spaces like slack channels so that others can follow or join</li>
  <li>Be patient with technological problems</li>
  <li>Using we language instead of you or I esp when learning on Project teams together</li>
  <li>Being a good listener and making space for others to speak their mind or answer questions especially if I’ve been the one talking</li>
  <li>Using inclusive language to make sure that we aren’t inadvertently accusing or attacking anyone</li>
  <li>Smile and show a bit of patience.</li>
</ul>

<!-- OHW20 discussion outcome
- Be respectful to others’ views; whether it’s technical question or scientific hypothesis
- Be inclusive regardless of technical expertise and career stage (emphasize the growth mindset)
- Acknowledge contributions
- Avoid irony and bad jokes
- “Silent Capture”: a google doc for people who feel uncomfortable speaking, so that ideas get captured
- Try to avoid a small number of people dominating the conversation
- Moderator in small groups

- Be mindful of how your verbal communication might be received without body language (yay virtual!)
- Recognize we have different working environments right now (kids, partners sharing the internet, other pandemic/work - from home challenges)
- Be aware that face-to-face interaction may not translate perfectly when we message each other Slack. 
- Don’t force others to turn on a microphone or webcam. There may be circumstances you are not aware of.
- Get to know each other
