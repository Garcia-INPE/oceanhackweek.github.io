# US - East

This year we are having two parallel low key events in Maine.
One event will be held at Bigelow Labs in Boothbay, and the other at Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland

## Organizers

## Logistics

We each have a small conference room or two booked for the week, and the ability to spread out to other locations in our labs.
We do not have housing or travel for either of our locations, so we are looking for local applicants.

Please apply to the `US-East` satellite event, and after people are selected we will reach out to see which location folks will prefer to be at.

We're also scheming to make sure we have a meet and greet so that folks get to connect with people based around the other lab.
