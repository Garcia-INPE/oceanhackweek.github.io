# OceanHackWeek 2022 (OHW22)

OceanHackWeek 2022 will take place **August 15-19, 2022**. The workshop will take a hybrid form consisting of a global virtual event and a number of regional “satellite” events that are either in-person or virtual. 

The OceanHackWeek program consists of hands-on tutorials, visual presentations, and collaborative hack projects throughout a 5-day period. Participants can apply for being in one of the regional satellites or only the virtual global event. Regional satellite events are connected closely with the global event, while providing additional collaboration and networking opportunities on a regional basis. 

See the [OHW21 program](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/ohw-resources) to get a better sense of the usual activities and how they're organized

## A Global Virtual Event and Six Regional Satellites

The **Global Virtual Event** will take place 3 hours per day over a 5-day period and include all interactive OHW22 tutorials delivered in real time, project brainstorming, and other OHW-wide community building activities. The tutorials will be recorded and posted after the presentation. The exact hours of this global event are still being finalized, but we anticipate the activity time to be structured around the US Pacific Time (UTC-7) this year.

[**Six** regional satellite events](satellites) will take place this year to serve as local connecting points for project work, community building, and engaging potential future OHW organizers. We invite participants geographically located near one of these regional satellites to apply specifically for these events. The satellite events may be virtual or in-person and take different formats depending on the event organizers. All in-person participants are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
