# OceanHackWeek 2022

OceanHackWeek 2022 will happen from **August 15-19, 2022**. The workshop will take a hybrid form consisting of a global virtual event and a number of regional “satellite” events that are either in-person or virtual. 

The OceanHackWeek program consists of hands-on tutorials, visual presentations, and collaborative hack projects throughout a 5-day period. Participants can apply for being in one of the regional satellites or only the virtual global event. Regional satellite events are connected closely with the virtual global event, while providing additional collaboration and networking opportunities on a regional basis.

## Applying for OHW22

Here is what you'll need to do. And go [here](applicants).

## OHW22 organizers

Mention the OHW22 organizing committee here, and link to it. Maybe encourage people to help, include email address.

## Global Virtual Event

The Global Virtual Event will take place 3 hours per day over a 5-day period and include all interactive OHW22 tutorials delivered in real time, project brainstorming, and other OHW-wide community building activities. The tutorials will be recorded and posted after the presentation. The exact hours of this global event are still being finalized, but we anticipate the activity time to be structured around the US Pacific Time (UTC-7) this year.

## Regional Satellite Events

Five regional satellite events will take place this year to serve as local connecting points for project work, community building, and engaging potential future OHW organizers. We invite participants geographically located near one of these regional satellites to apply specifically for these events. 

The satellite events may be virtual or in-person and take different formats depending on the event organizers. All in-person participants are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Regional satellites:

  - We’re having two small parallel events in Maine for participants in the Boothbay and Portland areas as there is no support for travel or lodging. We have conference rooms at both labs available as places for participants to gather, but there won’t be a whole lot of events or logistics scheduled past some scheming on getting the groups together for lunch or an evening.
