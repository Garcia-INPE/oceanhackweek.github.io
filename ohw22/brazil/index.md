## Format: Hybrid In-person projects and virtual tutorials
​
We plan to reserve a room at the university of Florianópolis to watch the tutorials and work on the project. However, we will allow students to participate remotely in case they are not conformable with the in person setup.

## Applicants profile: Local students

The goal is to give local students who believe are not ready to apply to the main OHW, or applied multiple times and were not selected, a chance to participate.

## Summary
​
1. We will watch all the broadcasted tutorials.
2. The project will be a hack session with a local data.
2. We will encourage students to communicate with the main event and other satellite events to augment their OHW experience.
