# OHW22 Regional Satellite Events

**Six** regional satellite events will take place this year to serve as local connecting points for project work, community building, and engaging potential future OHW organizers. We invite participants geographically located near one of these regional satellites to apply specifically for these events. 

The satellite events may be virtual or in-person and take different formats depending on the event organizers. All in-person participants are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
