# OHW-Español

**(Ir a la [página en español, aquí](index.es))**

A group of Spanish-speaking OceanHackWeek organizers and former OceanHackWeek participants came together in October 2021 to work together to advance data science in Oceanography in Latin America and other Spanish-speaking communities. We are organizing an OceanHackWeek 2022 satellite event that will have in-person gatherings in Perú and Uruguay and a virtual gathering for anyone independent of their location. We will work together on tutorials and projects across these groups, and in coordination with the rest of OceanHackWeek. Communication in this satellite will be mainly in Spanish, but will switch to English when connecting with others across OceanHackWeek. Specific ideas that have been proposed include:

- Perú: Tutorials and projects exploring and accessing satellite wind data and products in Python, to make statistics, associated with the Peruvian coastal upwelling process.
- Uruguay: Tutorials on basic R tools to extract and analyze satellite data and machine learning with a focus on coastal applications.
- Online: Preparing and presenting a tutorial online (via Zoom) on how to use Python to access CMIP6 climate change scenario data
- Tutorials presented in the in-person gatherings will also be made available to online participants

## Location

​Two groups will meet in person in Perú and Uruguay. Everyone else will join online via Zoom, Slack, GitHub, etc, with synchronous activities planned to be centered on UTC-4 time zone (Chile, Venezuela).
​
- Instituto del Mar del Perú (IMARPE), Santa Rosa, Lambayeque, Perú (UTC-5)
- Centro Universitario Regional del Este (CURE), Universidad de la República Uruguay, Rocha, Uruguay (UTC-3)

## Format

Hybrid, in-person and virtual. Details are being worked out. Check back later!

## Applicants profile

We welcome participants from all career stages and encourage applications from graduate students, postdocs and early career researchers. Advanced undergrad students with background in oceanography or data science are also welcome.

The in-person gatherings are intended for local participants. The online gathering will be open to anyone, regardless of location.

## Summary
​
1. Watch all the OHW tutorials (in English) together, and help each other with any problems
2. Develop and present tutorials in Spanish that provide more basic training in Python and R or enrich the OHW tutorials with more specialized materials.
3. Develop projects that may be focused on regions in Latin America or are based on interests from our satellite participants
4. Participants can asynchronously work on projects with participants of other OHW events (either the global virtual event or other satellites). Or participants can work on projects synchronously with other OHW Espanol participants.
5. Encourage participants to communicate with the main event (in English) and other satellite events to augment their OHW experience.

If you have general questions about the Español satellite, please ask them in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/oceanhackweek/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A+label%3A%22OHW22+-+Espa%C3%B1ol%22).
Please tag the organizers with `@oceanhackweek/ohw22-organizers-espanol` and add a `OHW22 - Espanol` label so that others can find answers about the satellite.
